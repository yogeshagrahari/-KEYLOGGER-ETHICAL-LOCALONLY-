# -KEYLOGGER-ETHICAL-LOCALONLY-
This Python script creates a Tkinter-based GUI for an Ethical Keylogger (mock version for testing). It provides controls to start, pause, resume, or stop logging and trigger screenshots. The GUI displays real-time status, configuration options (keystrokes, mouse, clipboard, screenshots), and session statistics.
